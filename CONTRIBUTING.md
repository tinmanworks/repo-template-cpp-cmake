# Contributing

## Branching Strategy

- `master` stable branch
- Feature branches: `feat/<topic>`
- Fix branches: `fix/<topic>`

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes focused
- Prefer small PRs
- Update documentation when behavior or structure changes

## Commit Message Format

Use clear prefixes:

- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `chore:` maintenance
- `refactor:` internal changes without behavior change

## Commit Signing

- Signed commits are required for release and protected branches.
- Verify local signing is configured before pushing.

## Code Quality
- Follow `.editorconfig`
- Keep structure aligned with repository template standards
