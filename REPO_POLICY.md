# Repository Policy

## Visibility

-   Experimental projects → private
-   Infrastructure / sensitive code → private
-   Reusable tools and libraries → public when stable
-   Academic/company-related work → private unless explicitly allowed

## Structure

All repositories created from this template must:

-   Maintain the documentation structure
-   Keep architecture documentation updated
-   Record major decisions as ADRs
-   Avoid mixing generated artifacts with governance files

## Standards

-   Keep repository root clean
-   Separate tooling from source
-   Prefer explicit configuration over implicit behavior
